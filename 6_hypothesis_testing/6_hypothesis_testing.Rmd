```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Let's use the code provided below to generate a dataset representing two populations, each sampled from a Guassian with a specific population mean. Here I am generating only 5 samples

```{r}
set.seed(110)
data_1 = tibble(measure=rnorm(5, 10, 1))
data_1$site_name <- 'Site 1'
data_2 = tibble(measure=rnorm(5, 12, 1))
data_2$site_name <- 'Site 2'
complete_data = rbind(data_1, data_2)
complete_data
```

* I compute the mean of the dataset above using the following code:
  * feel free to deconstruct the code to see what each chunk does.

```{r}
mean(complete_data[complete_data$site_name == "Site 1", ]$measure)
mean(complete_data[complete_data$site_name == "Site 2", ]$measure)
```

* Use the `tapply` function instead of the code above to compute the means samples from "Site 1" and those from site 2
  * See tapply for help if needed.

```{r}
# Write your code here
tapply(complete_data$measure, complete_data$site_name, mean)
```

Q.2 

* Use the bootstrapping-procedure covered in class to assess whether there is a statistically significant difference between the data in `Site 1` and that in `Site 2`.

Make sure you follow the approach discussed in class and which consists of:

1. Selecting an appropriate test statistic
2. Bootstrapping a a distribuion for the observed statistic under the null hypothesis
3. Desciding whether to accept or reject the null based on the probability of the null
4. provide a p-value to support your decision.

```{r}
set.seed(110)
data_1 = tibble(measure=rnorm(40, 10, 1))
data_1$site_name <- 'Site 1'
data_2 = tibble(measure=rnorm(40, 13, 1))
data_2$site_name <- 'Site 2'
complete_data = rbind(data_1, data_2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(complete_data, aes(x=measure, fill=site_name))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.4, bw=6) +
  xlim(-20, 40)

t.test(data_1$measure, data_2$measure, )

bootstrap <- replicate(1000, t.test(rnorm(40, 10, 1), rnorm(40, 13, 1))$p.value)
passes_t_test <- replicate(1000, t.test(rnorm(40, 10, 1), rnorm(40, 13, 1))$p.value < 0.05)

sum(passes_t_test)/length(passes_t_test)

#Reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the means of site 1 and site 2 (p=2.2e-16). After bootstrapping the data 1000 times, 100% of the outcomes had a p-value < 0.05.
```

#### Q2.0 

Complete the following by describing the null and the alternative hypotheses we are testing here.

```{r}
### Write your answer here
# Ho = There is no difference between the mean of site 1 and the mean of site 2.
# Ha = There is a difference between the mean of site 1 and the mean of site 2.
```

#### Q.2.1 

Produce a graph similar the one below (geom_density) display the distributions. If you're using the same seed as mine, your graph will look exactly the same as the one below 

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rz5jxm84kk8ac1m/dist.png?dl=1)

```{r}
# write your code here
ggplot(complete_data, aes(x=measure, fill=site_name))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.4, bw=6) +
  xlim(-20, 40)

```

Q2.2 Select a proper test statistic and produce a distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis. Plot the data as both a histogram and density curves. Your graph may look like this.

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jarqg9swneai0r/mean_under_null.png?dl=1)

```{r}
# Write your code here


getDiffmeans <- function(n=40){
  mean_1 <- n %>% rnorm(10, 1) %>% mean
  mean_2 <- n %>% rnorm(13, 1) %>% mean
  mean_1 - mean_2
}

diff_means <- replicate(1000, getDiffmeans())
ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(diff_means, y=..density..), bins = 30, alpha = 0.2, color = "black") +
  geom_density(aes(diff_means), bw = 0.08, size = 1.5) + 
  xlim(-4, -2) 

```

####  Q2.3. 

Calculate and plot the observed statistic on the graph you created in Q.2.2. 

```{r}
observed_value <- mean(data_1$measure) - mean(data_2$measure)

ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(diff_means, y=..density..), bins = 30, alpha = 0.2, color = "black") +
  geom_density(aes(diff_means), bw = 0.08, size = 1.5) + 
  xlim(-4, -2) + 
  geom_point(aes(observed_value, 0), color="red", size=10)

```

```{r}
#### Q2.4 
compute the p-vlaue of the observed statistic under the null. What do you conclude about the hypotheses you enunciated in Q


sum(diff_means <= observed_value) / length(diff_means)

#The difference between means is close to 1, suggesting that out two means are not from the same population, therefore we can reject our null hypothesis.
```

#### Q.3 

* The proportion of the of _P. lobata_, _M. capitata_ and _P. mendrina_ at a site X are c(0.60, 0.19, 0.21).
* You surveyed site Y with different environmental conditions and obtains the following proportions for the three corals (0.61, 0.19, 0.20). Use the multinomial non-parametric hypotheses test to assess whether the proportions obtained at sites X and Y are statistically different.


Although not explicitly required, your test should cover all the steps in Q2, i.e. appropriate graph(s) when possible, test statistics, and conclusion.

```{r}
#Ho: There is no difference in the proportion of each coral species between site 1 and site 2.
#Ha: There is a difference in the proportion of each coral species between site 1 and site 2.

site_1 <- data_frame(
  species = c('lobata', 'capitata', 'meandrina'),
  proportion = c(0.6, 0.19, 0.21),
  site = rep(c('site 1'), 3)
)
site_2 <- data_frame(
  species = c('lobata', 'capitata', 'meandrina'),
  proportion = c(0.61, 0.19, 0.2),
  site = rep(c('site 2'), 3)
)

coral_proportions <- rbind(site_1, site_2)

kruskal.test(site_1$proportion, site_2$proportion)

#Accept the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the proportions of each coral species between site 1 and site 2 (p=0.37)


ggplot(coral_proportions, aes(fill=site, y=proportion, x=species)) +
  geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity")
